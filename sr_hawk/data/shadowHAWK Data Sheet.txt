The data file shadow.csv contains a 23-column output from the HAWK algorithms. For simplicity the columns have been defined by the following variable names:

Wrist
- fe = flexion/extension of the wrist joint
- rud = radial/ulnar deviation of the wrist joint

Palmar Arch (three planes are defined for the palmar arch)
- rad/mid = flexion/extension angle defined between the radial and middle hand planes
- mid/uln = flexion/extension angle defined between the middle and ulnar hand planes

Fingers
- mcp = flexion/extension of the mcp joint 
- pip = flexion/extension of the pip joint 
- dip = flexion/extension of the dip joint 

- abd = abduction angle between the fingers

- abd2 = abduction between the index and middle fingers
- abd3 = abduction between the middle and ring fingers
- abd4 = abduction between the ring and little fingers

Thumb
- mcp = flexion/extension of the mcp joint 
- ip = flexion/extension of the ip joint 
- abd = abduction between the thumb and the radial hand plane
- rot = an extension of the palmar arch, rotation anatomically is the movement of the CMC joint that manifests in the angle between the thumb hand plane and radial hand plane

These data were collected by the Vicon system sampling at 100Hz. 50 frames are generated in the .csv file and they combine to the grasping portion of the activity only.
